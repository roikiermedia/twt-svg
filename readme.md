# twt-svg
An automatic Illustrator export of the tuwat design files.  
Beware: SVGs created by Illustrator a known to be shitty and may cause problems in some parsers. So maybe put the files through a tool like [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) to get the best compability.

If you like this thing, consider buying me a Mate @ #34c3. It wont pay for the Illustrator subscribtion, but it makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
